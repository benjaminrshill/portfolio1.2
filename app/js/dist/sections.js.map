The chief drawback hitherto on most of such machines is, that they require the continual intervention of a human agent to regulate their movements, and thence arises a source of errors; so that, if their use has not become general for large numerical calculations, it is because they have not in fact resolved the double problem which the question presents, that of correctness in the results, united with economy of time.\",\n            \"image\": \"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1536226957245-c83ec577a82e?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=800&q=60\",\n            \"link\": \"https://www.example.com\"\n        }\n    ],[\n        {\n            \"title\": \"About me\",\n            \"miniDesc\": \"Art + Code = Fun\",\n            \"desc\":\n                \"Having worn the hats of a teacher, database admin, and artist, I enjoy learning & problem solving, and art & design.\\n\" +\n                \"Living in Beijing for five years I learnt both Mandarin and tattooing.
